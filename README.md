# Hello Cognitive World

Setting up Watson API in Python, running ToneAnalyzer as an example.

This is the very first lesson of the [Cognitive Builder Course](http://cognitivebuilder.com/course/) developed by Galvanize in partnership with IBM.

**Before doing anything, we recommend you to clone this repository unto your computer so that you can work with a local version of the code.**

## 1. Installation & Setup (prerequisites)

This sequence consists in the installation of the tools necessary for using the python Watson API. It is a set of step-by-step tutorials to guide through:
- the [installation of Atom](prerequisites/1-atom_install.md) (text editor),
- the [installation of Python/Anaconda](prerequisites/2-anaconda_install.md),
- the [installation of the Watson <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>](prerequisites/3-watson_api.md),


## 2. Create, setup and connect to a first service instance (toneanalyzer)

This sequence will lead you to:
- [create an instance of Tone Analyzer](toneanalyzer/1-create_instance.md),
- [find the instance in the services console](toneanalyzer/2-find_your_instances.md),
- [setup your credentials to access the instance from your computer](toneanalyzer/3-setup_credentials.md),
- [execute a template code connecting to the instance using your credentials](toneanalyzer/4-hello_tone_analyzer.md).
- [use tone analyzer to identify emotions in a sentence](toneanalyzer/5-analyze_this.md).
